## Description

This project serves as showcase to demonstrate my comprehension and knowledge of working with MongoDB, Mongoose, and Express, in tandem with the MVC system.
This back-end API could be paired in the future with an intuitive front-end to create a social media web app.

During this I learned how to properly configure Mongoose database models and schemas and how to tie them in with Express.js routes.
